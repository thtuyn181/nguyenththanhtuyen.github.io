			<p>Yes, I majored in business in college and I used to be a CPA! I had a great job, stable career and yes, you can definitely call me a nerd. I loved plans – A good plan made me feel better, and trust me, I had everything all planned out. It definitely did not involve being a business owner, living abroad, or learning to code. And as the story sometimes goes, I met my husband, and he upended ALL of my careful plans! But I couldn’t be more thankful for the opportunity to live a life I could have never imagined and definitely not planned.

Like many of my customers, I started with literally no experience. I started tinkering with WordPress, googling everything over and over, and somewhere along the way, I got hooked! I eventually pursued a second degree in Computer Science (yep, still a nerd).  I still remember so clearly those early days of starting out. It’s one of the reasons customer service is so important to me – to be a friendly, helpful resource in a sometimes overwheling and frustrating process of building your website.</p>
